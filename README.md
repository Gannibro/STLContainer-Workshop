# Workshop 6: STL Containers
In this workshop, you store polymorphic objects in an STL container.


# Learning Outcomes:
* manage polymorphic objects using the vector container of the STL
* move a dynamically allocated object into a container
* code a range-based iteration on the objects in a container
* report and handle an exception


# Output of Programs:
The desired output of the written programs are to be compared to the provided sample outputs labelled as:
* sample_output_P1
* sample_output_P2

# Compiling and running:
The program needs to be compiled using the "g++" compiler with the command "g++ -o ws w6_p1/p2.cpp -std=c++11" which compiles the code using C++ version 11.
To run the program, the command "" must be executed.
